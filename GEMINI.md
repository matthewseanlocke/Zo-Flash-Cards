# Project: Zo Flash Cards

## Project Overview

This is a mobile-first flash card web application designed for learning letters, numbers, and colors. It's built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the Tailwind CSS framework for styling. The application is a single-page app (SPA) with all core logic contained within the `script.js` file. Key features include different content types (letters, numbers, colors), game modes (sequential, random), progress tracking, and session history stored in the browser's local storage.

## Building and Running

This project does not require a build process. To run the application, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

### Key Commands

*   **Running the app:** Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Development Conventions

*   **JavaScript:** The application logic is encapsulated in a single `FlashCardApp` class in `script.js`. The code is well-commented and follows an object-oriented approach.
*   **Styling:** The project uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, with additional custom styles and animations defined in `styles.css`.
*   **Versioning:** The project follows a semantic versioning scheme, with the version number prefixed with a `v` (e.g., `v1.6.3`).
*   **Documentation:** The `README.md` file is the primary source of documentation and is very comprehensive.
*   **Data Persistence:** User progress and session history are saved in the browser's local storage.
